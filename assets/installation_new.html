                Symbiotic Currents is an interactive installation that symbolises the connection between energy networks
                in nature and in technology. <br>
                It highlights the role of humans in bridging the gap and facilitating the harmony between the two.
                <br>
                The installation embraces an optimistic view of the future, and invites its audience to participate in
                the creation of that future.<br>

            The anthropogenic effect is the consequences of human behavior on nature.<br>
            We have created a biosphere that represents this accelerated process. <br>
            The public will be greeted upon entering with a soothing projection of leaf branches.<br>
            Sound from the public will change the biosphere.<br>
            Nature can heal, but it can never be returned to its original state. But what happens if you go too far?<br>

            you must first read out a statement of liability, <br>

            Fire kept us warm and safe. Fire was there for us. How could fire break our trust? How could fire destroy
            everything as though it was nothing? To this day, opinions on the fate of the fire are divided. Do we keep
            the fire with us, despite all the dangers it brings, or do we take away all its powers and extinguish it
            forever? Experience two sides of the story and then make the decision.<br>

                I want to present a clear, easy to understand picture of the soy industry, and the problems this
                industry brings. <br>
                Soy is a good example of how incomprehensible and unethical the global food industry can be. <br>
                From deforestation to feeding soy to cattle and all the travel it takes for a piece of meat to end up on
                someone’s plate. <br><br>

            videoplayer die gebruikt wordt voor deze installatie had ik in eerste instantie voor haar gebouwt in Isadora
            en toen later in Touchdesigner.<br>
